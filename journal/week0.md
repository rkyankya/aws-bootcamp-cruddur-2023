# Week 0 â€” Billing and Architecture

## Required Homework & Tasks

### *Recreate Logical Architectural Deisgn*
The first task is to recreate the logical architecture design from the previous week. This is a good way to get familiar with the tools and the process. The design should be recreated in Lucid Chart. I based my design on the one Andrew Brown was using in his tutorial
